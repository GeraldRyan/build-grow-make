  1: {"title":"The Engineering Mindset", "body":"One of my great loves is engineering. I love everything about it- the incorporation of science and math into a task, the design of a useful product, an illustration of how the human mind solves problems through an understanding of the universe, and the ability of a mind to have that understanding. It is also a bridge between the moderns and the ancients. Far from the moderns inventing or discovering everything (and we did discover a lot), the ancients set the stage. There really were remarkable men of ancient days, Archimedes who understood leverage and many other things, Euclid, the astronomers, and many more people lost to time.\n I love everything about ingenuity and the solutions that come from understanding many diverse fields- the understanding of principles (torque, friction, or force in geneal), the understanding of materials of life, with which we have to work, the understanding of stress and strain capacities and I love the ability to build or manufacture the thing itself, from a prototype with CNC or by hands with tools like a lathe or saws, routers and drill presses.\n I love the building of houses and of buildings. I love the design and architecturing of them. I love the knowledge of lift that enables us to fly in helicopters and planes. I love everything about the MacGyver Mindset. If you can learn this stuff, I think you should learn this stuff, formally or informally"},
  2: {"title":"The Creator's Mindset", "body":"To create is to give life to a thing, an entity, an object, a creation, and there is no greater feeling or pleasure than to create something into being, alone or with a team, something that you're proud of. It takes many factors- it takes a drive, an engineers mindset, the time and money, which doesn't have to be yours incidentally. But if it is meant to happen it will happen. Drive is put inside us. We don't create drive. It is just there. What our job is is to aim and keep aiming at the beautiful, at the desirable, at what we want. Our main job in life is to aim well and continue to aim well. If we can do that, if we can hold a good aim a clear and ever more clear and detailed and specific aim, good things will arise."},
  3: {"title":"The Investor's Mindset", "body":"The investor looks to the future, not as a creator but as a steward, as one desiring means, in order to fulfill his vision. All investors have vision; they necessarily must, but they are not creators per se. They can be but they are not inherently. They can be facilitators of creators, patrons of creators, and they can be creators in themselves, but (assuming they are good) they are sensible, down to earth, full of worldly wisdom, which is not a bad thing. They turn talents into tangible outcomes, into return values, which is what investing is all about- getting a return- whatever form you want it in- money or beauty or peace of mind. That is the investor's mindset "},
  4: {"title":"The Producer's Mindset", "body":"The producer wants to make. There is a definite distinction between the producer and the consumer's mindset but they are not mutually exclusive. To be a producer, one must be a consumer- and often a great consumer, in both senses of the word. All people are consumers but not all are producers. There is an art to consuming well, and that is one of the critical factors of success in life- to consume well, to consume time well, to consume ideas well, to consume materials well and consume money well, but to be a producer is another level- whether deliberate or instinctual and automatic. THat doesn't matter so much as long as the producer can produce, so that others can consume"},
  5: {"title":"The Artist's Mindset", "body":"The artist is an inspired one, by definition, by nature. It's the artists intention to elevate. Often the artist would like to reveal the dark, the tragic and convey a message, but the pure artist is not political or critical but hopes to elevate and inspire others, as she has been inspired to her art. She takes what she has available in materials and transmutes them, produces them into a product for consuming- and consuming is not a bad word. She need not be of the engineer's mindset, though she can incorporate into her art. Anyone can be an artist in any medium- public speaking, dance, design of buildings (architecture as Frank Lloyd Wright) etc. The artist is inspired, and acts on that inspiration whether to deliberately inspire others or just for the sake of acting on it in the moment. When the work is of a practical pragmatic nature and not a pure painting or dance, the artist in so far as she is an artist, adds artistry to her work that for the practical purposes would not be necessary to that extent. The artist goes beyond to achieve her vision according to her inspiration. That's the necessary and sufficient key to being of th artist mindset"}
