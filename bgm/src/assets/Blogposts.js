I love everything about it- the incorporation of science and math into a task, the design of a useful product, an illustration of how the human mind solves problems through an understanding of the universe, and the ability of a mind to have that understanding. It is also a bridge between the moderns and the ancients. Far from the moderns inventing or discovering everything (and we did discover a lot), the ancients set the stage. There really were remarkable men of ancient days, Archimedes who understood leverage and many other things, Euclid, the astronomers, and many more people lost to time.\n I love everything about ingenuity and the solutions that come from understanding many diverse fields- the understanding of principles (torque, friction, or force in geneal), the understanding of materials of life, with which we have to work, the understanding of stress and strain capacities and I love the ability to build or manufacture the thing itself, from a prototype with CNC or by hands with tools like a lathe or saws, routers and drill presses.\n I love the building of houses and of buildings. I love the design and architecturing of them. I love the knowledge of lift that enables us to fly in helicopters and planes. I love everything about the MacGyver Mindset. If you can learn this stuff, I think you should learn this stuff, formally or informally"},
